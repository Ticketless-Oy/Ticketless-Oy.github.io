      <div>
        <p>
          A registered person has the right to request the removal of their
          personal data from the register ("right to be forgotten"). Similarly,
          the data subject has other rights under the EU General Data Protection
          Regulation, such as the right to restrict the processing of personal
          data in certain situations. Requests related to these rights must be
          sent to email support@ticketless.fi.^

          When data is requested to be removed, we delete the user with all of its
          data and all user created content like ticket buying and selling listings
          with one exception being the chat conversations that user has been part
          of. We delete those chat conversations 90 days after the user removal to 
          make sure that we can track any scam attempts regarding the ticket trading.
