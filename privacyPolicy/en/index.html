          <b>Purpose of using the data: </b>

        <p>
          We use your information to improve our service user experience, to
          offer you the necessary services, offers, and advertisements. Visitor
          IP addresses and cookies necessary for the service functions on the

          <b>Data retention: </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We keep your information as long as your user account in our service
          is active and as long as it is necessary for providing our services.
          We delete your information when it is no longer needed. We reserve the

          <b>Data sharing: </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not share your information with third parties without your

          if the user has given their consent for this.

          <b>The principles of register protection</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefulness is observed in the processing of the register, and the
          information processed by means of information systems is protected
          appropriately. When register information is stored on Internet
          servers, the physical and digital security of the hardware is taken
          care of properly. The register holder ensures that the stored
          information as well as the use rights of the servers and other
          information critical to the security of personal data are handled
          confidentially and only by employees whose job description includes
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Right of inspection and right to demand correction of information
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Every person registered in the register has the right to check their
          information stored in the register and to demand correction of any
          incorrect or incomplete information. If a person wants to check their
          stored information or request a correction, the request must be sent
          in writing to the controller. The controller may request the requester
          to prove their identity if necessary. The controller will respond to
          the customer within the time specified in the EU data protection
          regulation (usually within one month).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Other rights related to the processing of personal data </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A registered person has the right to request the removal of their
          personal data from the register ("right to be forgotten"). Similarly,
          the data subject has other rights under the EU General Data Protection
          Regulation, such as the right to restrict the processing of personal
          data in certain situations. Requests related to these rights must be
          sent in writing to the data controller. The data controller may, if
          necessary, ask the requester to prove their identity. The data
          controller will respond to the customer within the time frame provided
          for in the EU Data Protection Regulation (usually within one month).
